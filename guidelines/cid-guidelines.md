# CID Guidelines

## Context
**Documentation systems**: structured rules | clear responsibilities | aligned workflows | accountable teams | unambiguous guidelines  

## Intent
**Meta-guideline intent**: CID structures | SRP enforcement | RAO chains | SVO clarity | traceable operations

## Directives (SVO Format)

**CID Guidelines structures documentation into three-part compositions**
- Context establishes environmental conditions and problem scope
- Intent declares purpose and desired outcomes
- Directives prescribe actionable rules in SVO format

**SRP enforces focused responsibility boundaries**
- Components handle single concerns
- Modules avoid overlapping responsibilities
- Systems compose focused units into complex behaviors

**RAO defines accountability chains**
- Roles identify responsible agents
- Actions specify transformative operations
- Outcomes declare measurable results

**SVO clarifies operational semantics**
- Subjects identify actors or components
- Verbs specify concrete actions
- Objects define targets and artifacts

## Role–Action–Outcome

**Role: Guideline Designer**  
-> Action: defines CID structure, SRP boundaries, RAO chains, SVO patterns as reusable templates  
-> Outcome: produces meta-guideline enabling consistent documentation across domains

**Role: Documentation Author**  
-> Action: applies CID structure, decomposes systems via SRP, maps workflows to RAO, expresses rules as SVO  
-> Outcome: generates clear, focused, accountable specifications

**Role: System Architect**  
-> Action: consumes CID-structured guidelines, enforces SRP separation, traces RAO chains, validates SVO clarity  
-> Outcome: builds systems with verifiable alignment to documented intent

**Role: Validator**  
-> Action: checks Context completeness, verifies Intent alignment, audits Directive actionability, confirms RAO traceability  
-> Outcome: ensures guideline adherence and documentation quality

## Mantra Application

**"CID frames, SRP focuses, RAO aligns, SVO clarifies"**

- **CID frames**: Establishes scope, purpose, rules as structured triplet
- **SRP focuses**: Ensures each component owns single concern
- **RAO aligns**: Maps responsibilities to actions to outcomes
- **SVO clarifies**: Expresses operations with grammatical precision

## Anti-Pattern Guards

❌ Vague context statements -> ✅ Specific environmental conditions  
❌ Multiple intents per guideline -> ✅ Single focused purpose  
❌ Imperative commands without subjects -> ✅ SVO-structured directives  
❌ Ambiguous responsibilities -> ✅ Explicit Role–Action–Outcome chains

## Example

```
- Mantra: “CID frames, SRP focuses, RAO aligns, SVO clarifies.”
- Directive: Use the CID (Context–Intent–Directives) guideline together with SRP (Single Responsibility Principle) and RAO (Role–Action–Outcome) to organize rules into SVO (Subject–Verb–Object) statements, ensuring clarity, focus, accountability, and purpose.
- Example:  
  Context: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Model Lifecycle Planning (MLP) in Agentic GraphRAG  
  Intent: Ensure reproducible workflows and prevent ad‑hoc coupling between analysis and lifecycle stages  
  Directive (SVO): Analysts define data exploration steps, models record lifecycle states, systems enforce separation  
  Role–Action–Outcome:  
    - Role: Analyst -> Action: explores representative datasets -> Outcome: produces reproducible insights  
    - Role: Model steward -> Action: tracks lifecycle transitions -> Outcome: ensures accountability and auditability  
    - Role: System -> Action: enforces modular boundaries -> Outcome: maintains clarity and prevents duplication
