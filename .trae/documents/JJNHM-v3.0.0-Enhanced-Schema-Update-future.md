# JJNHM v3.0.0 Enhanced Schema Update Documentation

## 1. Product Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive update of the JJNHM schema repository to version 3.0.0, incorporating advanced DMAG (Distributed Modular Architecture Governance) and FLOW (Universal Flow Governance) patterns. The update delivers enterprise-grade semantic web compatibility, automated publishing workflows with rollback capabilities, and enhanced multi-agent orchestration.

The implementation achieves superior performance targets: ≥7.0 concepts/token density, >97% semantic clarity, and comprehensive validation pipelines for production-ready schema governance.

## 3. Core Process

The implementation follows a systematic four-phase approach:

1. **Phase 1: Advanced Schema Foundation** → Update all schemas to v3.0.0 with enhanced metadata
2. **Phase 2: DMAG Architecture Integration** → Implement advanced distributed governance patterns
3. **Phase 3: FLOW Universal Implementation** → Deploy comprehensive flow governance
4. **Phase 4: Production Publishing** → Execute enterprise-grade automated publishing
